  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated: 2026-01-09</strong></p>
  <p>Social Insights Studio ("we", "our", or "us") operates the Social Insights Studio Connector ("the Connector"). This policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your choices.</p>

  <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>OAuth tokens and identifiers needed to access the TikTok Open Platform API (including <code>open_id</code>).</li>
    <li>TikTok account metrics and video analytics that you request through Looker Studio.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To authenticate you with TikTok and fetch the analytics you request in Looker Studio.</li>
    <li>To refresh access tokens so your dashboards continue to work without re-authenticating.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Storage and Security</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Tokens are stored on our backend at <strong>https://lstc.nixorcorporate.com</strong>.</li>
    <li>Tokens are encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM and stored outside the public web root.</li>
    <li>We do not store your TikTok password.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Retention</h2>
  <p>We retain encrypted tokens only as long as needed to provide the Connector. Tokens are removed only after the refresh token expires and the token has been inactive for at least 30 days.</p>

  <h2>5. Your Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can revoke access at any time in TikTok Developer settings.</li>
    <li>You can disconnect the connector in Looker Studio or request deletion by contacting us.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>Your data is subject to the policies of TikTok and Google Looker Studio when using their services.</p>

  <h2>7. Contact</h2>
